    Equivalent to ``set(permutations(iterable))``, except duplicates are not
    generated and thrown away. For larger input sequences this is much more
    efficient.

    Duplicate permutations arise when there are duplicated elements in the
    input iterable. The number of items returned is
    `n! / (x_1! * x_2! * ... * x_n!)`, where `n` is the total number of
    items input, and each `x_i` is the count of a distinct item in the input
    sequence.

    If *r* is given, only the *r*-length permutations are yielded.
